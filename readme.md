# AgriSense 🌿

A web app that helps farmers in **Wayanad, Kerala** decide what to grow — by combining soil analysis with market price forecasting into a single ranked recommendation.

Enter your soil parameters, get a ranked list of crops sorted by both how well they grow in your soil *and* whether prices are trending up or down over the next few months.

> Built as a final year BSc CS project at NMSM Govt. College Kalpetta · University of Calicut · 2026

## How it works

1. You enter 7 soil/climate values — N, P, K, Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall
2. A trained **Random Forest** model scores how suitable each crop is for those conditions
3. A **SARIMA** time-series model (trained on 2020–2025 AGMARK price data) forecasts the next 3-month price trend for each crop
4. Both scores are combined → crops are ranked by profitability

You can toggle between **Soil Match** (pure agronomic ranking) and **Market Profit** (price-adjusted ranking) in the results panel.

## Architecture

```
Browser (index.html)
    │
    │  POST /predict  {N, P, K, temp, humidity, pH, rainfall}
    ▼
Flask (app.py)
    ├── Load soil_dataset_model.pkl
    │       └── Random Forest → suitability probability per crop
    ├── Load market_trend.json
    │       └── SARIMA % change per crop (pre-computed)
    └── Integration formula
            FinalScore = (0.75 × Suitability) + (0.5 × MarketScore × 5)
    │
    │  JSON response  [{crop, suitability, market_trend, final_score}, ...]
    ▼
Browser renders ranked cards
Toggle: sort by suitability  ↔  sort by final_score

## Stack

- **Backend** — Python, Flask
- **ML** — Scikit-learn (Random Forest), Statsmodels (SARIMA)
- **Data** — Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend** — HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS
- **Notebooks** — Jupyter / Google Colab

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/ykverse/AgriSense.git
cd AgriSense

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy statsmodels joblib

# 3. Start the backend
cd backend
python app.py
# → running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

# 4. Open the frontend
# Just open index.html in your browser
```

The frontend calls `http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict` — make sure the Flask server is running first.
